=========
*cmv* is a collection of tools four the visualisation of Hidden Markov Models (*hmmv*) and RNA-family models (*cmv*).
Moreover it can visualise comparisons of these models (HMMCV,CMCV), the stuctural alignments they were constructed from and via 3rd party tools their consensus secondary structure.

They are available as a commandline tools and as a webservice [CMVS](http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/~egg/cmvs).

The source code of cmv is open source and available via GitHub and Hackage (License GPL-3):

    ### <u>Installation via bioconda</u>

     cmv can be installed with all dependencies via [conda](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html). Once you have conda installed simply type:

         conda install -c bioconda cmv=1.0.0 

    ### <u>Installation via cabal-install</u>

    cmv is implemented in Haskell and can be installed via the Haskell package distribution sytem [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/). Once you have cabal installed simply type:

         cabal install cmv

   ### <u>Installation via stackage</u>

     cmv can also be install via the Haskell package distribution sytem [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/), which guarantees consistent package builds. Once you have stackage installed simply type:

         stack install cmv


   ### <u>Precompiled Executables</u>
