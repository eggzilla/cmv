=========
*cmv* is a collection of tools for the visualisation of Hidden Markov Models (*HMMV*) and RNA-family models (*CMV*).
Moreover it can visualise comparisons of these models (*HMMCV*,*CMCV*), and annotate linked regions in the structural alignments they were constructed from and via, 3rd party tools, in their consensus secondary structure.

They are available as a commandline tools and as a webservice [cmvs](http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/CMVS/).

The source code of *cmv* is open source and available via GitHub and Hackage (License GPL-3):

### Usage via biocontainer (docker)

*cmv* can be retrieved and used as docker container with all dependencies via [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). Once you have docker installed simply type:

       docker run -i -t quay.io/biocontainers/cmv:1.0.6--0 /bin/bash

### Installation via bioconda

*cmv* can be installed with all dependencies via [conda](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html). Once you have conda installed simply type:

       conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge cmv
       
### Installation via cabal-install

cmv is implemented in Haskell and can be installed via the Haskell package distribution sytem [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/). CMV is implemented in Haskell and can be installed via the Haskell package distribution sytem cabal. Additionally to cabal you require [cairo](https://cairographics.org/), [pango](http://www.pango.org/), [happy](https://www.haskell.org/happy/) and [alex](https://www.haskell.org/alex/) which can be installed via the distribution package manager e.g. Ubuntu: 
        
        sudo apt-get install libcairo2 libpango1.0-0 libpangomm-1.4-dev happy alex
   
Once you have cabal installed simply type:

         cabal install cmv
