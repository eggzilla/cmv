=========
*cmv* is a collection of tools four the visualisation of Hidden Markov Models (*hmmv*) and RNA-family models (*cmv*).
Moreover it can visualise comparisons of these models (*hmmcv*,*cmcv*), and annotate linked regions in the structural alignments they were constructed from and via, 3rd party tools, in their consensus secondary structure.

They are available as a commandline tools and as a webservice [cmvs](http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/~egg/cmvs).
